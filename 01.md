## What is Middleware in Express.js?
- In Express.js, middleware refers to functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the server, specifically between the time the server receives a request and sends a response.

## Middleware can:

- Modify the request and response objects.

- End the request-response cycle.

- Call the next middleware in the stack.

## Syntax:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // logic
  next(); // pass control to the next middleware
});
```

## Types of Middleware:
- Application-level middleware

- Router-level middleware

- Built-in middleware

- Error-handling middleware

- Third-party middleware

## Examples:
### 1. Logging Middleware (Application-level)
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // move to next middleware
});
```
### 2. Built-in Middleware (express.json)
```js
app.use(express.json()); // Parses incoming JSON requests
```

### 3. Router-level Middleware
```js
const router = express.Router();

router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Router-level middleware triggered');
  next();
});
```

### 4. Error-handling Middleware
```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

### 5. Third-party Middleware (e.g., cors)
```js
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors()); // Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
```

## Why Use Middleware?
- Logging

- Authentication

- Parsing request bodies

- Handling errors

- Serving static files

- Applying security policies
