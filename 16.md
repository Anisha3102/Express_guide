# What is CORS and how do you enable it in Express?

- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how resources hosted on one origin (domain) can be requested from another origin. It prevents unauthorized domains from accessing APIs or resources unless explicitly allowed.

## Why CORS is needed:
- By default, browsers block requests from a different origin for security. CORS provides a way for the server to specify who is allowed to access its resources.

## Example Scenario:
We are building a frontend app at http://localhost:3000 that tries to fetch data from an API at http://localhost:5000. Without CORS enabled on the backend, the browser will block the request.

## Enabling CORS in Express:
### Step 1: Install the cors middleware
```bash
npm install cors
```
### Step 2: Use it in your Express app
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

// Enable CORS for all routes
app.use(cors());

// Sample route
app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'CORS is enabled!' });
});

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 5000');
});
```
## Advanced Configuration Example:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000', // Allow only this origin
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],        // Allow only these HTTP methods
  credentials: true                // Allow credentials (cookies, auth headers)
}));
```
