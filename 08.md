# What Are Middleware Functions in Express?
- In Express.js, middleware functions are functions that execute during the request-response cycle. They have access to the request (req), response (res), and the next() function. Middleware can:

## Execute code

- Modify the request or response object

- End the request-response cycle

- Call the next middleware in the stack

## Middleware Function Signature
```js
function (req, res, next) {
  // Your logic here
  next(); // Call next middleware
}
```
## Example of a Simple Middleware
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Continue to next middleware/route
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express with Middleware!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
## Common Types of Middleware in Express

| Type              | Description                                               | Example                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Application-level | Binds to an instance of `express()`                      | `app.use(...)` or `app.get(...)`         |
| Router-level      | Works like application-level but bound to `express.Router()` | `router.use(...)`                        |
| Built-in          | Provided by Express itself                                | `express.static()`, `express.json()`     |
| Third-party       | Installed via npm                                         | `body-parser`, `cors`, `morgan`          |
| Error-handling    | Has 4 parameters: `(err, req, res, next)`                | Handles errors globally                  |
