# What is the purpose of next() in Express middleware?

- In Express, the next() function is used in middleware to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.

## Purpose of next():
- Without next(), the request would hang, because Express wouldnâ€™t know what to do next.

- It allows you to chain multiple middleware functions together.

## Example:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Logger middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware/route
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});
```
- If next() wasn't called, the request would never reach the / route.

## Use Cases:
| Case                     | What `next()` does                                                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Normal middleware        | Moves to the next middleware or route                              |
| Error-handling middleware| Skips to the error handler when passed an error (`next(err)`)      |
| Conditional flow         | You can decide when to call `next()` based on logic                |

## With error:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const err = new Error('Something went wrong');
  next(err); // Jumps to error-handling middleware
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).send(err.message);
});
```
